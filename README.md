# Paradise Cake

This is not a real cake shop! I made this website just to have fun with React, and I also wanted to practice React hooks and 
                        engage with responsivity challenges. Yes, this simple-looking website actually reveiled many issues when adjusting it on various screen sizes,
                        but I'm not scared of challenges and now this website is <strong>perfectly responsive</strong> ðŸ˜Ž
